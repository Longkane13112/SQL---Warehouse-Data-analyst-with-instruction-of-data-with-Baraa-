# SQL---Warehouse-Data-analyst-with-instruction-of-data-with-Baraa-
This is my first SQL project, guided by Data with Baraa (YouTube). Using the provided dataset, I analyzed the companyâ€™s situation and practiced fundamental SQL queries such as SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY. Through this project, I learned how to structure a professional workflow and upload my work on GitHub.
